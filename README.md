# Control
Control is my personal project intended to replace numerous spreadsheets I use to control things about my life and productivity with a single program.

# Definitions

## Task
Tasks are organized in a tree-like structure, each one can have subtasks and only one parent. The subtasks of task tree root (called main task) are the major objectives to complete. A task is something relevant, in other words, the time dedicated working on it (and on its subtasks) is something to be known.

## Period
Time period working in a certain task continuously.

## To-do
States something to do in a task (can also specify the day it should be done), it is deleted after this something is done. To-dos are used like a check-list for task completion and are relatively quick to complete, they are not relevant enough to be a task.
